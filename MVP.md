# ROSY LENS ðŸŒ¹ ðŸ¥€

Rosy Lens uplifts people with positive affirmations who need a boost of happiness and encouragement (with the option to link to music or a bible verse).

## MVP 
The app visually represents the user's potential mood through a rose that either strengthens in vibrancy or wilts. Based on a mood assessment, the user "waters" the rose (engaging interaction) to reveal a personalized affirmation, song snippet, or bible verse, reflecting a moment of self-care.

### Features
- <u>Mood reader</u> (gauges your mood from list of 3-5 questions)
- <u>Positive deliverable</u> (provides affirmation, song or bible verse based on user input/responses)
- <u>Rose visual</u> (animation that changes vibrancy/health based on initial mood selection)
- <u>Watering interaction</u> (User selects which deliverable they would like to receive and this is the big reveal)
- <u>Rose animation</u> (e.g., color subtly changing to more vibrant/healthy) and display of affirmation 
- <u>Exiting slogan</u> an option to return to home, share link,or save the affirmation

**Tools/Frameworks Needed**
- YouTube API 
- Bible Verse API
- React, CSS, Express, Node, and PostgreSQL

**Nice to haves**
- YouTube API (for both music/visually calming imagery)
- Imagery that turns bible verse or song title into a cute post to share (their mood/affirmation on other social platforms)
- User Management (forgot password verification, change username option)


**Technical Risks**
- API misreading the user input/mood and providing the wrong affirmation
- Generating the wrong type of bible verse that is not accurately correlated to the userâ€™s mood
