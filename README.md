# What You'll Need 
Prior to running this project, here are the pre-reqs you'll need. Please make sure you've got these installed on your computer:

* **Node.js:** This runs the app (you'll want version 16 or later)
* **npm** Node Package Manager
* **PostgreSQL** This is where we'll keep all our user's mood data. Make sure it's up and running! Mock data is provided in my db.sql file to get you started ‚úÖ
* **Vitest** For running unit tests _(cd into client and use the command **npm test** to run test files)_

# Installation Instructions
Below is a step-by-step to run my project locally ‚≠êÔ∏è

## Part One

**1. Clone my repo**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/courjimen/Rosy-Lens-Final.git
```

**2. Install dependencies in directories**

Cd into client and run the following commands:
```bash
npm install -D vitest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom
```

```bash
npm install react-router-dom @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
```
<br/>

Cd into server and run the following command:
```bash
npm install pg cors express nodemon node-fetch && npm init -y
```

Return to the root directory and run this command:
```bash
npm init -y && npm install concurrently
```

## Part Two 

**3. Set up database**

You'll need to use `psql` to create your tables locally. Sign in _(make sure postgres is installed!)_ with the following command:

```bash
psql postgres
```

Next, cd into server and follow the steps in my `db.sql` file. Copy/paste the code into your terminal.

**4. Insert database credentials** 

Cd into server and open `db.js` and input your database connection details (username, password, etc.) _**use `/conninfo` to find your database credentials if you are unsure**_

**5. Let's run it**

Now we're ready to run the app! Navigate back into the root directory and run the following:

```bash
npm run dev
```
This will start both the server and the client. You should be able to see the app in your browser at `http://localhost:5173/` while the server will be running on `http://localhost:3000/`.

# Key Features
- **Mood reader** gauges your mood from list of 3-5 questions
- **Positive deliverable** provides affirmation, *song or bible verse based on user input/responses
- **Rose visual** animation that changes vibrancy/health based on initial mood selection
- ***Watering interaction** User selects which deliverable they would like to receive and this is the big reveal
- ***Rose animation** e.g., color subtly changing to more vibrant/healthy and display of affirmation 
- **Shareable Card** an option to share link or visual snippet to social media platforms

*<u>Nice to haves:</u> Upcoming features that will be implemented at a later date
